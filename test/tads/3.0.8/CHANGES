    * tads2/osunixt.c: os_get_event() now properly redraws the screen
      before waiting for an event (this is done by calling
      osssb_redraw_if_needed()).  Dan Shiovitz provided this fix.
    * tads3/Makefile: Added "t3res" target for building the Tads 3
      command line resource compiler, added "mkchrtab" target along with
      its dependencies for building the Tads character table generator,
      changed the "install" target to also install the t3res and
      mkchrtab utilities

    * New upstream release 3.0.8
    * tads3/Makefile: Added warning about -fno-strict-aliasing in Linux
      section, changed Trill's pointer from ../README to ../INSTALL,
      removed the install-strip target and made install strip the
      binaries (there's no point in keeping the compiler's debug
      symbols), changed the -R option to -fR in the chown invocation in
      the install-common target (to hide the warnings when the user is
      not root and is installing in his home directory)
    * tads2/Makefile: Added PREFIX and DATADIR variables (like in
      tads3/Makefile) and made the install target install adv.t, std.t
      and gameinfo.t into DATADIR
    * INSTALL: Added some info about the Glk interpreter, other minor
      cosmetic changes
    * README: We lack an "official" maintainer
    * NEWS: Created

    * New upstream release 3.0.7
    * tads2/: renamed "makefile" to "Makefile"
    * tads3/: renamed "makefile" to "Makefile"
    * tads2/Makefile: removed "dummy.o" from the build, since it's
      obsolete in Tads 2.5.8
    * tads2/glk/Makefile: removed "dummy.o" from the build
    * tads2/glk/os_glk.c: dummy implementation of os_nonstop_mode()
    * tads3/Makefile: removed "vmosc.o" from the build, since it's
      obsolete in Tads 3.0.7
    * tads3/Makefile: removed Tads 2 object "dummy.o" from the build

    * New upstream release 3.0.6m
    * INSTALL:  Remove Suzanne Skinner's Email address
    * tads3/makefile:  Change from DOS format (CRLF terminated) to UNIX
      format (LF terminated) (Thanks to D. J. Picton)
    * tads2/makefile, tads3/makefile:  Add -fno-strict-aliasing option
      for Linux, to work around a segfault bug while compiling with GCC
      3.3 (Thanks to Daniel Schepler and Antti Markus)

TODO list:
- Fix the conflict of variable ``PC'' and ``ospeed'' between osunixt.c
  and ncurses library
  (Nikos: The conflict arises because we want combatability with the
  termcap library; the primary target of the Unix-port.)
- Make menu system working on Solaris (maybe also ncurses related)
- Find the segfault reason with strict aliasing and fix it
  (Nikos: The problem is in the portable code, not the Unix code. No
  idea where though.)
