This package contains the sources of the UNIX port of TADS.
TADS 2 version 2.5.9, TADS 3 version 3.0.8

Currently, the port lacks a maintainer.  For now, send questions and
bug-reports to <realnc@lycos.de> and I'll try to help.

For installation instructions, please refer to the INSTALL file.

	Tads 2 compiler (tadsc) along with supporting libraries
	Tads 2 interpreter (tadsr)
	Tads 2 debugger (tdb)
	Tads 2 Glk-based interpreter (optional)
