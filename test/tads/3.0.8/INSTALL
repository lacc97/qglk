These are the unified TADS 2/3 sources for Unix and Unix derivatives.
Eventually, compiling and installing them will be as easy as 1-2-3
(read: "configure, make, make install"), but we're not to that point
yet.  For now, this is the procedure to follow:

    - Go into the tads2/ directory.

    - Follow the instructions in tads2/Makefile to configure it for
      your system.

    - Type "make".

    - Type "make install" to install the binaries under /usr/local/bin
      and the TADS 2 development libraries under /usr/local/share/tads2
      (or whatever directories you specify as BINDIR and DATADIR).  If
      you're only interested in the TADS 3 programs, you can skip this
      step.
      
    - If you want to build the Glk version of the TADS 2 interpreter,
      go into the tads2/glk/ directory, edit the Makefile, and type
      "make".  There's no "make install"; simply copy the generated
      executable wherever you want (you might want to rename it first,
      or change the name in tads2/glk/Makefile, in order to not
      overwrite the normal TADS 2 interpreter).  Note that you'll need
      a version of the Glk library suitable for your system in order to
      create the Glk interpreter.  A Glk library is not included in
      this package.
      
    - If you're only interested in TADS 2, stop here. :-)

    - Go to the tads3/ directory.

    - Follow the instructions in tads3/Makefile to configure it for
      your system.  If you want to build debuggable binaries (necessary
      for "make test"), uncomment CFLAGS_DEBUG.

    - Type "make".

    - If you'd like to test TADS 3, type "make test" (useful if you're
      hacking around in the sources and want to verify that you didn't
      screw up).

    - Type "make install" to install the binaries and libraries in
      the locations you specified in the Makefile.

    - If you like, try out the TADS 3 sample game by going into
      tads3/samples and typing "t3make -f sample" followed by
      "t3run sample".

The primary point to remember is that you must first compile in tads2/
before you can compile in tads3/ (TADS 3 uses parts of TADS 2).

GNU make is recommended.
