3.0.8 (Unix patch 1)
====================

  - Two new command-line tools have been added to the Tads 3 build;
    "t3res" and "mkchrtab".  The first is used to embed resource files
    into a Tads 3 game (like a "gameinfo.txt"), while the latter creates
    character mapping table files.

  - A bug that caused recent TADS 3 games to crash the interpreter when
    trying to display a banner has been fixed.  Although this fix is not
    specific to the Unix port (it existed in the base code), it's listed
    here since it was a quite serious one.

  - Fixed a bug where the screen was not updated properly when a game
    was waiting for an input after showing a [More] prompt.  Thanks to
    Dan Shiovitz for providing this bugfix.


3.0.8
=====

  - When installing TADS 2 ("make install" in tads2/), the development
    libraries will now also get installed.  For this purpose, the
    DATADIR variable has been added in tads2/Makefile.  By default, it
    points to PREFIX/share/tads2, where PREFIX is something like
    /usr/local.
